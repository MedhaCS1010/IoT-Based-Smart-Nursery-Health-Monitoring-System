# IoT-Based-Smart-Nursery-Health-Monitoring-System
Plants are really sensitive w.r.t. their environment parameters including temperature, moisture, sunlight, water level, soil nutrient etc. Considering a small / large scale Nursery Business owner it becomes difficult to monitor the health of every plant individually without manual cost intervention. Our Project will be dedicated to solve the challenging tradeoff between “maximize plant health/survival vs minimal effort and cost” using IOT. The designed system will monitor moisture, temperature and light level (can be customized based on individual plant requirement before deployment) and will be sending retrieved data / email to the owner (wifi module / web request / API) based on which event / action can be triggered or performed by the owner remotely which in return will improve plant health and survival eventually business profit as well. The project can also be improved with an automated irrigation system which would water the plants automatically based on the reading received from sensors or through website / app, and a security system, where the sensors would detect any object within a certain radius of the plant and alert the owner.
